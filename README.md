# grabhandle

Requirements: Develop and deploy an application capable of collecting all the Twitter handles listed on a set of web pages. Given a list of URLs, output a list of twitter handles for each URL.

Step #1: Select a language. At DIG our primary/default programming language is Python. However, for the sake of this project you should feel free to select from the list of languages provided. [Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP]. As part of your language selection please communicate your familiarity/expertise with the selected language on a scale from 1-10 with an accompanying description of your experience with the chosen language.

Step #2: Communicate the details for your intended implementation. 

How do you plan to solve the challenge?
What do you consider to be the minimum viable product (MVP)? 
What are your stretch goals, if any? (There is no expectation on meeting all of your stretch goals. You should consider the stretch goals as vision setting.)
Step #3: Deliver the application: Share the application, its git repository and your theoretical next steps with me by end of day (midnight) Sunday, February 19th (Please don't stay up until midnight).
